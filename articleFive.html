                Success is a state of mind! Things that happen in our environment can influence how we think and, as a result, our outcomes. The secret to success is to cultivate a positive mindset, maintain it strong, and ensure that we build a solid foundation on which to thrive.

                Many businesses chose to close their doors due to the year that was. I completely see why they couldn't see a future for themselves, or why they were already struggling and this was the last straw. As an entrepreneur, I'm used to the highs and lows of company, and my enthusiasm for what I do drives me to think of new ways to generate cashflow during the lows. This keeps business exciting and me as a business owner on my toes. Setting a goal always produces outcomes. When the passion fades, the cash flow stops flowing. I'm reminded of some advise I received that resonated with me during one of my less productive moments.
               
                
            </p>
            <p class="lead custom-MB">
              
                <strong> <i>"Businesses collapse because of a lack of drive to find new sources of revenue flow."</i></strong>
            </p>
            <p class="lead custom-MB">
                
                
                Yes, having a demand for our products is critical, but businesses collapse when the individual who is enthusiastic about it abandons it. I completely understand; there have been times when I've wished to take a step back, and while I enjoy what I do, creating cashflow to support development and keep things going can be taxing. But it all works out in the end, and I'm on my way to becoming a better person.
            
            </p>
            <p class="lead custom-MB">
                
              
                One thing I've found is that when the well runs dry, it's typically because there's a reason that necessitates taking a different route to the destination.

                The enthusiasm for the project is dwindling. I quickly realise I've been missing something, and this will help me get back on track, and then it'll be full steam ahead once more. Most slumps can be cured with a shift in perspective and, more often than not, a pause or time out to allow me to see the solution more clearly.

            My top three suggestions for businesses that feel like they're failing are as follows:

           </strong></div>
                
            </p>
            
            <p class="">
                
               1. Don't be afraid to think beyond the box. Nothing is ever as horrible as it appears to be, and there is always a way out.

                
            </p>
            <p class="">
                
                2. Take a break, go for a walk, and take a step back from the problem to see if a solution emerges.

                
            </p>
            <p class="">
                3. Take advantage of your relationships.

               Despite the fact that some people had a difficult time in 2020, my company, like many others, thrived. Due to the length of time spent in quarantine, company owners and aspiring authors used the time to check off the box of authoring their books. In addition, there were more people reading books. It's a publisher's dream come true.

                
               </p>

                In the beginning of 2021, there was a new phenomenon called Clubhouse, which I didn't understand at first but quickly realised had the potential to help me form strong and meaningful connections and become more visible in social circles I might not have encountered otherwise. I enjoyed the opportunity to give value to others through my words as a natural born giver who shows up truthfully in every arena, but I also appreciated the insights and introductions I received from like-minded people who were on the platform for the same reasons I was.

                
            </p>
            <p class="lead custom-MB">    
                
               
                I don't see Clubhouse going away anytime soon; it's brilliant, and with so many high-profile people contributing and connecting, it's a high-value platform.

                 
            </p>
            <p class="lead custom-MB">    
              
                
                I've seen Clubhouse take up many people's days, and I'm curious to see how the benefits balance up in their favour. I truly believe that this is the best thing that has ever happened to people who have invested time in the platform.

                <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>What will thrive in life and business is where we spend our energies. It's necessary to be aware of this, but we shouldn't deny ourselves of the activities we enjoy simply because there's work to be done. In fact, I would go so far as to recommend that if you are not working in a profession that makes your heart sing, you should check in with your life to see if you are aligned with your life's aims, dreams, and goals. If you're having trouble finding that balance, try the following suggestions:

                1. Think of something positive you can add or subtract from your life right now to improve your quality of life. It could be as simple as finishing 30 minutes ahead of schedule!

            <p class="">    
               
                2. Make a conscious effort to spend some additional time with someone you enjoy being around.

            <p class="">    
               
                3. Recognize that we all go through seasons in our lives, and it's fine to adjust your lifestyle to accommodate a new path.
