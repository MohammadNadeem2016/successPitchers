            <p class="lead custom-MB">
                
                Women's empowerment is a nascent notion that is changing with each passing day. While some see it as a debatable matter, certain committed leaders firmly believe in the epiphany of women's empowerment and demonstrate the strength of women in every major business. Andrea Mandelbaum, the founder and CEO of Mc Luhan Consulting, is a powerful businesswoman who exemplifies the importance of women in the workplace, particularly in technology. "I'd want to see more women in the technical field as entrepreneurs." Because I know how difficult it is, I am filled with pride when I meet women who have made their ambitions come true," Andrea adds. Her accomplishment serves as an example to all aspiring female leaders, encouraging them to take the leap of faith with zeal and tenacity.
          
            </p>
            <p class="lead custom-MB">
                
                Every advancement, from internet access to artificial intelligence, has resulted in a superior version. As commonplace as it may appear now, it was not so a few decades ago. As a result, beginning a business in a technologically challenged era was not a simple task. Andrea has been at the forefront of this technological revolution with the formation of Mc Luhan Consulting, thanks to the tireless work of technology enthusiasts who have redefined the potential of technology in a fantastic way.

            </p>

        <div class="paragraphContainer">
            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Establishing the Company in an Unfavorable Environment</strong></div>
            <p class="">

                Andrea identified her interest in technology at a young age and realised she would encounter several obstacles if she tried to start a technical firm at an era when internet access was limited. Andrea, on the other hand, believed in her enthusiasm and her entrepreneurial spirit, which led her to start multiple technology initiatives at the age of 16.
          
            </p>
            <p class="">
            
                Andrea started Mc Luhan with a business concept that involved selling music CDs and films over the phone with home delivery, which is distinct from what the firm does now. Andrea continued to evolve and improve the company's offerings as the technological landscape changed. She subsequently began supplying services to businesses that provide services, such as call centres, direct marketing, market research, and BTL advertising. These services have been the cornerstone of Mc Luhan Consulting's present activities. In addition to delivering technology-based customer relationship services, the firm has created its own solutions, such as Replikante and Retail Innovation, as well as third-party integrated solutions.

            </p>

            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Challenges Stimulate Growth</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Andrea had two major hurdles when she founded Mc Luhan in 1996: one was a geopolitical concern, and the other was gaining acceptability as a young woman in the field of technology. The firm was founded in Argentina, which is a politically and economically turbulent country. Every change in government policy would modify the rules of business, forcing the organisation to react to new standards. Andrea and her team were inspired to expand their business into Brazil, Chile, Peru, Columbia, Mexico, and Panama as a result of this challenge, which allowed them to be more creative and resilient. "I often say that if I can run a firm for 25 years in Argentina, I can do it in any nation," Andrea explains.
            
            </p>
            <p class="">

                Women were not widely accepted in the technology field back then, unlike now, especially a young lady like Andrea who had no prior business experience. Andrea, on the other hand, was a firm believer in her aspirations and worked hard to accomplish them. She is now the proud leader of a thriving technical firm that employs 70% women and is in a position of enormous influence to change the technological industry in her own distinctive way.

            </p>

            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>A powerful leader and a successful entrepreneur</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Andrea's entrepreneurial career has been defined by freedom: the ability to freely invent, project, and implement technology ideas. Andrea's key duty as CEO of Mc Luhan Consulting is to establish the company's vision and strategy, causing disruption in new technology, business, and work models. Andrea discusses fresh ideas with her colleague throughout multiple sessions as soon as she has them, looking for alternative approaches and ways to apply them. She then talks with the Investigation and Development team to determine the best tools for developing, integrating, and creating a successful technical solution. It then returns to the business and operations team, where costs and prices are established.

            </p>
            <p class="">

                Andrea individually conducts perception testing for new solutions in order to identify interest, maturity, buy inclination, pricing, and business model, so that required modifications may be made before the product is released to the market. Andrea is actively involved in every aspect of the business and lends her experience to each sector. "I don't feel like I'm in the technological industry. My thoughts are always focused on how technology may be utilised to solve issues, improve experiences, and provide a better quality of life,” Andrea shares.

            </p>
            <p class="">

                Andrea encourages her team to attend events and conferences, use webinars, participate in forums, and have a group among some company partners where they share useful information about technological innovation, market, and competency investigation to keep team spirit high and encourage a healthy work environment. This aids in the development of results-oriented solutions.

            </p>


            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Keeping Work and Personal Life in Balance</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Andrea makes time for her own personal development as well. Her path began as a young, self-sufficient businesswoman who was entirely committed to the company's growth. Andrea, on the other hand, is now married with two gorgeous children who are actively involved in the company's operations. They also go on business trips with her to spend more quality time together. Andrea credits her business success to her associates, family, and friends, all of whom have backed her up throughout her career. “Leading so many roles is not easy, but everyone knows that I am passionate about my job and it makes me happy”, Andrea shares.

            </p>
            <p class="">

                Andrea has a balanced personal and professional life, and she urges all ambitious businesswomen to do the same. "My advice to aspiring entrepreneurs is that both portions can be planned and structured, and that we don't have to sacrifice our personal lives for our business." "What truly important is giving each person quality time," she continues.

            </p>
            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Providing Innovative and Excellent Services</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Mc Luhan is a consulting firm that specialises on customer-company partnerships in order to create distinctive technology-based experiences. They've produced Replikante, a multichannel talking bot, as one of their own solutions. It is built on artificial intelligence (AI) and is one of a kind in the market because it was created in native Spanish, English, and Portuguese. Because it does not translate, the bot can have a degree of knowledge and case solution that is greater than 90%. It adapts to the rhetoric language patterns of each culture, whether spoken or written. Because it can converse on the phone and write on WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, SMS, E-mail, or a web chat, it is multichannel. Because it is designed for the following markets: banking, telecommunications, insurance, retail, health care, and mass consumption, training and launch may take anywhere from a week to a month, as it does not need learning the jargon of each industry.

            </p>

            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Changing Technology for Better Outcomes</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                When compared to the results obtained by human agents, the Replikante bot generates and saves 50% to 70% for the clients, resulting in a greater level of client satisfaction. This achievement aids in the development of customer service, debt collection, sales, and inbound or outbound marketing management in businesses. In the insurance market, for example, a team of agents files a claim and sends it to a back-office team, which produces a claim number, while another team handles tow trucks and garage scheduling. Finally, a different staff verifies the appointment and keeps track of the situation. All of those procedures, from start to finish, may now be controlled only by Replikante. Conversations are held in a natural language style. For example, if patients describe their condition to a health care company, the bot understands and asks additional questions to perform a triage, and depending on the situation, it can send an ambulance, send the patient to a nearby health centre, schedule an appointment with a specialist, or refer the call to a physician in line. 

            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                Mc Luhan's solution can diagnose 85 percent of the health-care problems that come into a contact centre. Human specialist consultants must make up the remaining 15%. As a result, Mc Luhan Consulting can give 100 percent help, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                They introduced virtual try-on in 2020, after years of development. Given the current pandemic condition, it has become the ideal answer for e-commerce, as buyers can try on makeup, hair colours, sunglasses, footwear, and even décor and household goods without leaving their homes. Mc Luhan Consulting is the only firm in Latin America that counts, try on, for all categories of personal and household requirements. Andrea and her team keep up with the growing competition by updating their technology solutions on a regular basis.

            </p>


            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Taking a Step into the Future with a Clear Vision</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Mc Luhan is dedicated and engaged in the developing technological sector, considering the new dynamics of technology from 2021. Andrea's goal is to be five to ten years ahead of the technology curve. The company launches one or two new solutions each year and has switched to a PPU business model (Pay per use). This concept is advantageous to businesses who wish to experiment with new technologies or have changing demand. By 2020, their retail solutions had grown to the point where they needed to develop a Retail Innovation department with experts in trademark and technology-based marketing image. They've also started working on AR, VR, and mixed reality solutions, which will be the future way to shop in the next years. Immersive experiences for buying procedures will be the norm.
           
            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                Their strategy will continue to provide cutting-edge technical solutions with demonstrable outcomes, resulting in excellent customer experiences. They want to continue developing its bot Replikante for client management from end to end, 100 percent digital and without human interaction, in areas such as health care, banking, telecommunications, insurance, retail, and mass consumption.

            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                Mc Luhan Consulting has been providing outstanding technical solutions for over 25 years and has no plans to stop. The firm has reached milestones in the technology industry under Andrea Mandelbaum's leadership and continues to evolve every day. Andrea defied the obstacles, followed her heart, and rose to prominence as a powerful woman in a male-dominated sector, exemplifying the true meaning of female empowerment. She will continue on her path with the goal of inspiring and innovating.
