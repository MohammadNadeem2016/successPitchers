            <h6 class="title customFont">Jon Ferrara: Transforming Businesses by Providing Refined CRM Solutions</h6>
            <p class="lead custom-MB">

                The CRM market is expanding at a breakneck pace and getting increasingly sophisticated. Mobile and cloud apps are leading the way for businesses who want real-time access to customer data. They must now be able to connect applications and technology to customer data in order to provide a more customised experience. Jon Ferrara, the company's founder and CEO, understands this need because he was in a similar circumstance when he founded Nimble in 2009. "CRM should properly stand for 'customer reporting management,' since CRMs don't work for you — you work for them," he says. He is revolutionising the CRM business with Nimble by creating a CRM that is currently dominating the field of social selling.
          
            </p>

        <div class="paragraphContainer">
            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>The Concept of Nimble</strong></div>
            <p class="">

                In 1989, Jon started GoldMine Software Corp. He built the first modern CRM into a $100 million dollar corporation in the 1990s, when corporate usage of the Internet was only getting started. He did it without an ad budget, social media access, or cellphones at the time by using Influencer Marketing.          
            </p>
            <p class="">
            
                Nimble was founded as a result of Jon's own struggle to develop relationships in the digital era. He began using social media while it was still in its infancy and instantly understood how it would revolutionise the way businesses worked, played, bought, and sold. Then he began looking for a CRM that would help him to manage his contacts in social media successfully. Jon continues, <i> "The strange thing is that I never wanted to be a salesperson." "I majored in computer science in college. After two years at Aerospace, I realised I wasn't cut out for the job. After that, I took a job as a salesperson for a computer company. I rapidly recognised I was having trouble scaling connections, engaging with my team, and meeting my company objectives."</i>
            
            </p>
            <p class="">
            
                Jon immediately learned, however, that there wasn't one on the market since CRMs were all about reporting, not relationships. He was certain that the finest CRM cuts over departmental lines and ensures that everyone in the organisation is on the same page. As a consequence, Nimble was born, and it has since grown into the easy-to-use, intelligent CRM for Office 365 and G Suite.
           
            </p>
            <p class="">

                "This was before Outlook or Salesforce," Jon explains. "There was no contact management technology in place, and teams couldn't simply interact with one another." There wasn't a single platform that included email, contacts, calendar, sales, and marketing automation. That's how I began my career as a CRM, contact management, and relationship management pioneer."
                </p>
            <p class="">
            
                "I truly enjoy building these tools because they not only empower myself, but they also empower others," he continues. It's in line with my own attitude that we're all here to help others flourish. I create connection management tools and educate others how to construct large-scale partnerships. If you teach someone how to fish, I believe they will ultimately discover that you sell fishing poles. I sell relationship fishing poles, and that's what I do."
            </p>
            <p class="">
            
                Nimble inspires individuals who connect with others as a people-centric leadership firm. It primarily caters to real estate experts, financial advisers, mortgage bankers, headhunters, and others.
            </p>
            
            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>A Convenient Integrated CRM</strong></div>
            <p class="">

                Nimble is the industry-leading CRM for Office 365 and G Suite that creates award-winning contact management solutions for teams and people, with headquarters in Santa Monica, California. Its main goal is to make CRM as simple as possible, thus it provides a CRM system that integrates the power of relationship management, unified conversations/communications, social networking capabilities, and team collaboration all in one place.
               
            </p>
            <p class="">

                The firm organises clients and their teams, allowing for more effective communication between businesses and their connections via a single centralised SaaS platform, regardless of whether they use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Microsoft Teams, or email. Most significantly, the CRM system can track the client's progress, arrange the next meeting, keep track of notes, and assign assignments to help them transform their business connections into gold mines. Nimble has now grown significantly, with over 100,000 registered users and over 10,000 paying clients across the world.
               
            </p>

            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Unique Features</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Being creative or exceeding competition is critical for a company's development and success. Nimble has developed a unique approach that sets it apart from the competition. It's the first CRM that "automatically" creates and updates records so that clients always have the most up-to-date information. Clients may use CRM at any time and from any location to perform their tasks. Most CRMs just handle relationship management, thus sales intelligence, sales enablement, and sales automation aren't truly covered.
               
            </p>
            <p class="">

                Nimble features built-in intelligence, SFA (Sales Force Automation), and templated email tracking to help with this. Nimble's CRM is designed to empower customer-facing business team members in addition to relationship management, lead flow, and reporting.
                
            </p>
            <p class="">

                Nimble's Nimble Prospector browser extension works for you anywhere you work (in your inbox, on social networks, in your favourite apps, and on any webpage).
                
            </p>
            <p class="">

                Nimble users can manage relationships from Nimble Prospector, which includes prospecting new contacts, enriching leads with business details such as email and phone, logging activities, viewing contact and company details for existing contacts, sending trackable email templates, applying tags, and more.
                
            </p>

            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Connecting with Disney</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                "CRM isn't about management's 'command/control' – it's about empowering front-line resources to serve customers better and that there is a need for improving customer experience," Tiffani Bova (a former Gartner analyst and current Global Customer Growth and Innovation Evangelist at Salesforce) tweeted in the fall of 2017.
                
            </p>
            <p class="">

                Tiffani's tweet prompted Disney's Global Public Policy Systems Analyst Theo Rand to respond by citing Jon Ferrara and Nimble. He stated that Nimble had pleased him, but that he was unsure if sales managers would release their hold. This drew Jon's attention right away. Most CRMs, he believes, fail to enable customer-facing employees to effectively connect with prospects and customers, and instead serve as reporting tools for their managers. Jon used Nimble's Smart Contacts App to "auto-magically" establish a record of who Theo is, where he works, and what he does in order to learn more about him. Nimble learned Theo is the head of CRM and Data at Disney, much to Jon's amazement.
               
            </p>
            <p class="">

                After finding Theo's contact information with Nimble Prospector, Jon decided to write Theo an email after leaving a comment on his Twitter feed. Jon claims that by talking about Theo the way he did, Theo granted him permission to contact him via email. "It was a private affair." He was well aware of my identity. He knew what my passion was and what my company was all about, so I felt at ease reaching out to thank him for mentioning me. He continues, "I also asked to contact with him to understand more about him." "This is how you should approach people." You should connect with the intent of learning more about the other person and discovering values that will offer value to their path," Jon explains. 
               
            </p>
            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Personal CRM is a First in the Industry</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Nimble was a pioneer in social CRM and social selling before the influence of social media on business was fully realised. When the corporation saw the people embrace social selling and social media became everywhere, it moved beyond focusing on it. People are also encouraged to utilise CRM to develop their own brand and network.
               
            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                "Now, what we're working on is pioneering easy, smart CRM for the rest of us," Jon says, "basically transforming CRM from being complex and tough to being something that people actually like using." Not just the sales staff, but the entire organisation." The CRM sector will see significant changes in the near future. Jon believes that the future of CRM will be focused on enabling greater relationships in order to create a better future.
               
            </p>

            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Managing Other Responsibilities While Focusing On Building a Great Team</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Excellent firms, according to Jon, are driven by great teams. Passionate innovators lead great teams. "Think of firms like Ford or Edison," he continues, "all of them were driven by entrepreneurs with excellent ideas." These firms' founders were able to assemble teams of clever people who shared their vision, gave them the freedom to do what they do best, and then got out of their way. Leaders that attempt to be all things to all people end up accomplishing nothing."
                
            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                As a result, a great team works to create a product or business that performs at its best. Similarly, the Nimble team is working hard to provide an innovative solution that will help the company grow and prosper. Jon seeks to strike a balance at Nimble between attaining massive growth and the team's general pleasure.
               
            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                "Some people assume 'CEO' means Chief Executive Officer," Jon says, "but I think it means Chief Evangelical Officer." He generates fantastic ideas, assembles excellent people, and then continues to spread the brand storey. He makes sure that his tales are shared with others, and he doesn't consider himself an executive, but rather a team member. "I think that a company's brand is founded on the promises it makes and the experiences it provides; most of those experiences are provided by your customer-facing business team members," Jon says. Empower your employees to develop their own brand in order to develop the company's brand - this would ideally also humanise your brand."

            </p>


            <div class="strongHighlighter"><strong>Thoughts and Opinions</strong></div>
            <p class="">
               
                Jon has a remark on life lessons that he came up with on his own. The "three P's of life success," as he puts them, are passion, plan, and purpose. Jon thinks that if you practise and recognise these three P's, you will completely alter yourself. Perhaps not in the way you had envisioned, but the adventure you will take and the locations you will see will change your life for the better.

            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                "You can obtain anything you want by helping people get whatever they want," he says in another great life lesson statement. Because Jon thinks that service is the new sales, he creates the tools that people need to develop better connections at scale. "We're on this earth to develop our souls by assisting others in developing theirs," Jon adds. "The more individuals you assist in growing, the more you will grow."

               
            </p>
            <p class="">
               
                Jon is certain that our existence on this planet serves a higher purpose. Jon believes that in the short time you have here, you should be as present as possible. You will get more out of life if you are there with other people. "The importance of not spending your day obsessing on the past, worrying about the future, clutching the things you treasure too tightly, or avoiding the pain you might experience from dealing with whatever you need to deal with," he adds.
